## How to enable forced execution for jump bytecodes?

* Serveral possible ways to do it:

  1. Intercept the dispatch mechanism. However, the dispatch process is embeded in the turbofan graph. So changing it is just like change the bytecode handlers, which is determined before js script code is executed.

  2. Instrument the bytecode (e.g. add a assignment to the accumulator before conditional jumps) based on branch results of previous runs. But the problem is that instrumentation is also a static concept and it's impossible to enable branch switching for the specific runs while keep other runs untouched.

  3. Change conditional jump bytecodes in the bytecode array to their couterparts. For example, change JumpIfFase to JumpIfTrue and vice versa.

  Both 2 and 3 need to think about how to avoid compilation cache.

  4. Change the bytecode handlers. Find a way to make them responsive to the outside at runtime. 

  5. Change the dispatch table which directs conditional jumps to couterpart ones.
